# Refugee Workshop

This repository is the base for our kartenmacherei refugees workshop. For a period of 5 weeks we invited 10 refugees into our office to prepare them for an apprenticeship in Germany. Every week our team gave 1 - 2 hours insights into relevant topics such as HTML, CSS or git. Afterwards the participants had the opportunity to foster their learnings in a practical hands-on session.
